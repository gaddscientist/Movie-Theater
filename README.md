# Movie-Theater

This project was done for my college databases class to demonstrate knowledge in creating a database and interaction via SQL
functions/queries.  

For this project, I chose to implement the web interface using PHP as it was a technology/language I was unfamiliar with.  
Simlarly, I chose to use a MVC(Model View Controller) design pattern as it was a design pattern I had yet to try.  
Finally, the data as well as SQL functions were all created from scratch and are visible in the theater.sql file.  

This project simulates an application that a manager of a movie theater would use to oversee their store.  

**Features include:**  
  - Logins for different managers using safely hashed passwords  
  - Dynamic dashboards for each location  
  - Ability to list/search for staff members, as well as view and edit their information  
  - Ability to list current and upcoming movies as well as view and edit their information  
  - Ability to create and add new employees as well as movies to a given location  
  - Ability to track financial transactions for a given day or month  
  - Additional functionality limited to chain owner to add new managers and store locations
